# Food Security Through Garden Projects

## Project Description
This research project investigates how food gardens in South African communities contribute to food security and support the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of No Poverty and Zero Hunger. Through research, mathematical modeling, and community engagement strategies, the project aims to promote sustainable gardening practices that can be adopted by households, schools, and community organizations.

## Supported Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
- **No Poverty:** Food gardens provide economic opportunities and reduce household food expenses.
- **Zero Hunger:** Local food production increases access to fresh, nutritious food.

## Research Findings (Case Studies Summary)
### 1. School Food Garden in Gauteng
- Feeds 200 students daily with fresh vegetables.
- Integrated into the school curriculum.
- Uses compost from school food waste.
- Statistics:
  - Area: 20 m²
  - Yield: 80 kg/month
  - Yield per m²: 4.0 kg

### 2. Urban Rooftop Garden in Western Cape
- Utilizes unused rooftop space in the city center.
- Hydroponic system saves water.
- Supplies local restaurants with fresh herbs.
- Statistics:
  - Area: 5 m²
  - Yield: 15 kg/month
  - Yield per m²: 3.0 kg

Additional case studies include community farms, home gardens, and permaculture systems with varying yields and benefits.

## Recommendations and Strategies
### Key Strategies for Community Gardens
- **Vertical Farming:** Maximize limited urban space by growing upwards with trellises, stacked planters, and wall gardens. Ideal for leafy greens and herbs, reduces ground space by 70%, and eases maintenance.
- **Water Conservation:** Implement efficient irrigation systems such as drip irrigation (saving up to 60% water), rainwater harvesting, and mulching to reduce evaporation.
- **Natural Pest Control:** Use organic methods like companion planting, beneficial insects (e.g., ladybugs), and homemade organic sprays (garlic, neem oil).

### Implementation Roadmap
1. **Community Engagement:** Hold workshops to educate community members about food gardening benefits and methods.
2. **Resource Mobilization:** Secure donations of seeds, tools, and materials from local businesses and government programs.
3. **Site Preparation:** Prepare garden sites with soil amendments, irrigation, and fencing if needed.
4. **Planting & Maintenance:** Establish planting schedules and maintenance rosters among community members.
5. **Harvest & Distribution:** Create fair systems for harvesting and distributing produce.

### Additional Resources
- Government programs, educational materials, and funding opportunities are available to support community gardening initiatives.
